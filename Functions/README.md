#Function Assignments

We are going to write four different function programs.  There are four different combinations of return type and parameter list that can be used to write a function.

1.  Pass no arguments to the function and return nothing.
2.  Pass no arguments to the function and return a value.
3.  Pass arguments to the function and return nothing.
4.  Pass arguments to the function and return a value.

##Our problem:
Given the length and width (in feet) of a square parcel of land, convert that parcel of land from square feet to acres.

```html
1 acre = 43560.174 square feet
```

####Each of our programs will have the same logic:
1.  Obtain the length of the parcel of land (in feet – a decimal).
2.  Obtain the width of the parcel of land (in feet – a decimal).
3.  Calculate the square footage.
4.  Convert the square footage to acres.
5.  Output the number of acres.

######If you write the code to the first program well, you can reuse the code in the other three assignments.
1.  Little green things (comments).
2.  Good variable names.
3.  One variable per line with a comment for each variable explaining why you need the variable.
4.  Indentation.
5.  Use the skeleton program I have included as a starting point.
