######Create a Coord class:

1. Class has 4 private data items.

>  ```int xPoint;```
>  ```int yPoint;```
>  ```int zPoint;```
>  ```float deg;```

2. Write the setters and getters. They should be inline functions.
3. Write a member function named void display() that displays the data items in the following format:

>    Blank line
>    xCoord is                   ????????
>    yCoord is                   ????????
>    zCoord is                   ????????
>    Degrees are                 ???.??
>    Distance to origin          ???
>    Blank line

4. Write a member function named ```int distance2origin()``` that calculates the distance from the (x, y, z) point to the origin (0, 0, 0).
