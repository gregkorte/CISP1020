#Constructor Assignment 02
###Date02
1.  Start with your Date class in the Date.cpp file (from Date01 assignment).
2.  Add the following constructors to the date class:
 - a.  Create a constructor that takes 3 integers
       * i.   In the order month, day, year.
       * ii.  Assigns the month, day, year parameters to the corresponding data items.
       * iii. Use the ‘setter’ to assign the values.
 - b.  Create a 'default' constructor - no arguments.
       * i.  Use the ‘setters’ to assign values.
3.  1 to the month.
4.  1 to the day.
5.  1900 to the year.
6.  Create your test plan.  This test plan is simple.  Just list a way to test each constructor.
7.  Upload this test plan document.
8.  Code and execute your test plan.
 - a.  Create a function named void testDate02().
 - c.  Put the code test of your test plan here in this function.
 - d.  Call this function from main to test your new functions.
 - e.  I would not necessarily read in a month, day, and year from the keyboard but hard code your numbers.
9.  Upload the .cpp file.
10. Upload the test plan document.
