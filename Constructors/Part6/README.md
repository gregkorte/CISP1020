1.  Start with your Date class in the Date.cpp file (from Date03 assignment)
2.   Change the data items (month, day, and year) to pointers
3.  therefore, each constructor will have to have code entered to allocate memory for the three data items
4.  if you have designed your class properly (and used all your getters and setters instead of the data item name), you just need to change your getters and setters and all is well
5.  add the destructor and ‘delete’ the allocated memory
